This transcript discusses the concept of passing functions as arguments, also known as callbacks, in JavaScript. Let's review the important terms and ideas mentioned:

1. Built-in array methods: These are methods available for arrays in JavaScript, such as push, pop, reduce, find, and forEach.

2. Callbacks: Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions. In the context of array methods, callbacks are often used to perform operations on array elements.

3. Function declaration: The instructor demonstrates two ways to define functions. The first is a function declaration using the `function` keyword followed by a name, parameters, and function body.

Example:
```javascript
function holler() {
  console.log('HEY YOU');
}
```

4. Function expression: The second way is a function expression where a function is assigned to a variable.

Example:
```javascript
const whisper = function() {
  console.log('I have a secret');
};
```

5. Functions as values: Functions can be treated like any other value in JavaScript. They can be stored in variables, assigned to object properties, or passed as arguments to other functions.

6. Using callbacks: Callbacks are commonly used in JavaScript for asynchronous operations. The instructor shows an example using `setTimeout` function, which takes a callback function and a duration as arguments.

Example:
```javascript
setTimeout(whisper, 4000);
```

7. Writing functions with callbacks: The instructor demonstrates how to write a function that accepts a callback function as an argument. They provide an example function `doMath` that performs arithmetic operations based on the passed callback function.

Example:
```javascript
function doMath(a, b, mathFunc) {
  return mathFunc(a, b);
}
```

8. Passing functions in arrays: Functions can be stored in arrays, similar to other values. The instructor shows an example of storing math functions in an array.

Example:
```javascript
const mathFuncs = [add, subtract, multiply, divide];
```

9. Anonymous functions: The instructor explains that functions can be defined anonymously without a specific name. Anonymous functions can be used directly as callback functions.

10. Demonstrating the use of callbacks: The instructor shows examples of using the `doMath` function with different math functions and passing anonymous functions as callbacks.

Example:
```javascript
doMath(7, 3, multiply);
doMath(30, 25, function(a, b) {
  console.log(a ** b);
});
```

11. Performing multiple operations with callbacks: The instructor introduces the `doAllMath` function, which accepts an array of math functions and performs all the operations on given numbers.

Example:
```javascript
function doAllMath(a, b, mathFuncs) {
  for (let func of mathFuncs) {
    console.log(func(a, b));
  }
}
```

These concepts demonstrate the flexibility of JavaScript functions and how they can be passed around as arguments to other functions. The examples provided showcase the usage of callbacks and the ability to perform various operations based on the passed functions.
