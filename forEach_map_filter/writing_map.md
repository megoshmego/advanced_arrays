The transcript discusses the concept of implementing a custom version of the `map` array method. Here's a breakdown of the important terms and ideas:

1. `map`: An array method that creates a new array by applying a transformation or mapping function to each element of the original array. It executes a callback function on each element and collects the return values in a new array, preserving the order of the elements.
   - Syntax: `array.map(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])`
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
     const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);
     console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6]
     ```

2. Implementing a custom version: The transcript provides a code snippet to demonstrate how you can create your own version of the `map` method.

   - `myMap` implementation:
     ```javascript
     function myMap(array, callback) {
       const mappedArray = [];
       for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
         const val = callback(array[i], i, array);
         mappedArray.push(val);
       }
       return mappedArray;
     }
     ```

3. The callback function: The `myMap` method takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is executed for each element in the array and transforms the element according to the specified logic. It should return the modified value that will be added to the new array.

4. Transformation logic: Inside the callback function, you have access to the current element, the index, and the entire array. You can use this information to perform any desired transformation or extraction of data from the element.

5. Creating a new array: The `myMap` method creates a new array `mappedArray` and populates it with the transformed values returned by the callback function. It then returns this new array, which contains the mapped values.

6. Differences from `forEach`: The custom `map` implementation is similar to the custom `forEach` implementation discussed earlier. However, the key difference is that `map` creates a new array with the transformed values, while `forEach` only performs an action on each element without returning a new array.

By creating a custom `map` method, you can apply your own transformation logic to each element of an array and obtain a new array with the modified values. This is useful when you need to perform operations on each element and collect the results in a separate array.
